## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Async-await development

### What I learned

In this exercise I have practised to use flexbox and asyncronous call development.

### Useful resources

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function - This helped me to use async - await. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/asyncawait-vs-promises-abdul-rasheed/ - This is a useful article which helped me finally understand difference between async-await and Promises. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
